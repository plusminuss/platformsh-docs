# Configure your Application

You control your application and the way it will be built and deployed on
Platform.sh via a single configuration file, `.platform.app.yaml`, located at
the root of your application folder inside your Git repository.

Here's an example of a minimalist `.platform.app.yaml` file for PHP:

```yaml
# .platform.app.yaml

# The name of this app. Must be unique within a project.
name: 'app'

# The type key specifies the language and version for your application.
type: 'php:7.0'

# On PHP, there are multiple build flavors available. Pretty much everyone except
# Drupal 7 users will want the composer flavor.
build:
  flavor: 'composer'

# The relationships of the application with services or other applications.
# The left-hand side is the name of the relationship as it will be exposed
# to the application in the PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS variable. The right-hand
# side is in the form `<service name>:<endpoint name>`.
relationships:
    database: 'mysqldb:mysql'

# The configuration of app when it is exposed to the web.
web:
    locations:
        '/':
            # The public directory of the app, relative to its root.
            root: 'web'
            # The front-controller script to send non-static requests to.
            passthru: '/app.php'
        # Allow uploaded files to be served, but do not run scripts.
        # Missing files get mapped to the front controller above.
        '/files':
            root: 'web/files'
            scripts: false
            allow: true
            passthru: '/app.php'

# The size of the persistent disk of the application (in MB).
disk: 2048

# The 'mounts' describe writable, persistent filesystem mounts in the application. The keys are
# directory paths, relative to the application root. The values are strings such as
# 'shared:files/NAME', where NAME is just a unique name for the mount.
mounts:
    '/web/files': 'shared:files/web-files'

# The hooks that will be performed when the package is deployed.
hooks:
    # Build hooks can modify the application files on disk, but not access any services like databases.
    build: |
      rm web/app_dev.php
    # Deploy hooks can access services, but the file system is now read-only.
    deploy: |
      app/console --env=prod cache:clear
```

> **Note**
> This configuration file is specific to one application. If you have multiple
> applications inside your Git repository (i.e. a RESTful
> web service and a front-end, or a main web site and a blog), you need
> one `.platform.app.yaml` at the root of each application. See the [Multi-app](/configuration/app/multi-app.md) documentation.

### Name

The `name` is the unique identifier of the application. Platform.sh
supports multiple applications within a project, so each application
must have a **unique name** within a project. The name may only be
composed of lower case alpha-numeric characters. (a-z0-9).  *Be advised
that changing the `name` of your app after it's been deployed will
destroy all storage volumes, and thus is typically a Very Bad Thing to do.*
It could be useful under certain circumstances in the early stages
of development but you almost certainly don't want to change it on 
a live project.

This name is used in the `.platform/routes.yaml` file to define the HTTP upstream
(by default `php:http` - if you called your application `app` you will
need to use `app:http` in the upstream field).

You can also use this name in multi-application relationships.

> **Note**
> Changing the name of an app is the same as deleting it and replacing
> it: your app data (static files) will be deleted.
>
> If you change the name you should think about updating your other
> configuration files: `.platform/routes.yaml` and any other
> `.platform.app.yaml` files you have in a multi-application project.

### Type

The `type` defines what language will run your application.

The `type` can be:

* [`php`](/languages/php.md)
* [`hhvm`](/languages/php.md)
* [`nodejs`](/languages/nodejs.md)
* [`python`](/languages/python.md)
* [`ruby`](/languages/ruby.md)

followed by a version.  See the appropriate language page for all available versions.

**Example**

```yaml
type: php:5.6
```

### Build

The `build` defines what will happen by default when building the application.

Its only property is `flavor`, which specifies a default set of build tasks to run. Flavors are language-specific.

* PHP - default `composer`
  * `composer` will run `composer --no-ansi --no-interaction install --no-progress --prefer-dist --optimize-autoloader` if a `composer.json` file is detected.
  * `drupal` will run `drush make` automatically in one of a few different ways.  See the [Drupal 7][/frameworks/drupal7.md] documentation for more details. We recommend only using this build mode for Drupal 7.
* Node.js
  * `default` will run `npm prune --userconfig .npmrc && npm install --userconfig .npmrc` if a `package.json` file is detected. Note that this also allows you to provide a custom `.npmrc` file in the root of your application (as a sibling of the `.platform.app.yaml` file.)

In all languages you can also specify a flavor of `none` (which is the default for any language other than PHP and Node.js), which, as the name suggests, will take no action at all. That is useful when you want complete control over your build steps, such as to run a custom composer command or use an alternate Node.js package manager.

**Example**

```yaml
build:
    flavor: composer
```

### Access

The `access` define the user roles who can log in via SSH to the
environments they have access to.

Possible values are:

* ssh: admin
* ssh: contributor
* ssh: viewer

### Relationships

The `relationships` defines how services are mapped within your
application.

The left-hand side is the name of the relationship as it will be exposed
to the application in the *PLATFORM_RELATIONSHIPS* environment
variable. The right-hand side is in the form
`<service name>:<endpoint name>`. where "service name" comes from the
 `.platform/services.yaml` and  "endpoint name" should be the same as the
 value of "type"  declared in that same file.

> **Note**
> In the first  example above you could very well have something
> like `mycache: "arediscache:redis"` instead of `redis: "redis:redis"` (if in
> `services.yaml` you named your a service of type `redis` with `arediscache`.

*Example*

```yaml
relationships:
    database: "mysqldb:mysql"
    database2: "mysqldb2:mysql"
    cache: "arediscache:redis"
    search: "searchengine:solr"
```

> **Note**
> See  the [Services](/configuration/services.md) documentation
> for a full list of currently supported service types and service endpoints.

### Web

The `web` key defines how the application is exposed to the web (in HTTP). Here we tell the web application how to serve content, including static files, front-controller scripts, index files, index scripts, and so on. We support any directory structure, so the static files can be in a subdirectory, and the `index.php` file can be further down.

> **Note**
> Gzip compression is enabled only for serving precompressed static files with the ".gz" filename extension.
> However, dynamic content is not automatically compressed due to a [well known security issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BREACH_%28security_exploit%29).

It has the following subkeys:

#### Commands

The `commands` key defines the command to launch the application.

It has a few subkeys which are:

* `start`: The command line to use to launch the application. Can be a string, or *null* if the application is only made of static files. It's filled out during the build process for PHP.

*Example*

```yaml
web:
    commands:
        start: "uwsgi --ini conf/server.ini"
```

#### Upstream

`upstream` is an optional key that describes how your application listens to
requests, and what protocol it speaks.

The following subkeys can be defined:
* `socket_family`:
    Default: `tcp`. Describes whether your application will listen on a
    Unix socket or a TCP socket. Can be either `tcp` or `unix`.
* `protocol`:
    Specifies whether your application is going to receive incoming requests
    over HTTP, FastCGI, or UWSGI. Can be `http` or `fastcgi`, for now. The
    default varies depending on which application runtime you're using. Other
    values will be supported in the future.

##### Socket family

The value of the `socket_family` key controls whether your application will
receive requests over a Unix socket, or a network socket.

If it's set to `unix`, the runtime will set the `SOCKET` environment variable
to contain the path to the socket that you should configure your application to
listen on.

If it's set to `tcp`, the runtime will set the `PORT` environment variable with
the port that you should configure your application to listen on.

If your application isn't listening at the same place that the runtime is
sending requests to, you'll see *502 Bad Gateway* errors when you try to
connect to your web site.

#### Locations

The `locations` key allows you to provide specific parameters for different URL prefixes. Each entry's key is an absolute URI path (with leading `/`), and its value is configuration directives for that path.  That is, if your domain is `example.com` then `"/"` means "requests for `example.com/`", while `"/admin"` means "requests for `example.com/admin`".

*Example*

```yaml
web:
    locations:
        "/":
            ...
        "/sites/default/files":
            ...
```

It has a few subkeys, which are:

* `root`:
    The folder from which to serve static assets for this location,
    relative to the application root. The application root is the directory in
    which the `.platform.app.yaml` file is located.  Typical values for this
    property include `public` or `web`.  Setting it to `""` is not recommended,
    and its behavior may vary depending on the type of application.  Absolute
    paths are not supported.
* `passthru`:
    Whether to forward disallowed and missing resources from this location to
    the application. Can be true, false or an absolute URI path (with leading
    `/`), the default value is false. For non-PHP applications it will
    generally be just true or false.  In a PHP application, this will typically
    be the front controller such as `/index.php` or `/app.php`.  This entry
    works similar to `mod_rewrite` under Apache.  Note: if the value of
    `passthru` does not begin with the same value as the location key it is
    under the passthru may evaluate to another entry. That may be useful when
    you want different cache settings for different paths, for instance, but
    want missing files in all of them to map back to the same front controller.
    See the example block below.
* `index`:
    The file or files to consider when serving a request for a directory. Can
    be file name, an array of file names, or *null*. Typically `index.html`.
    Note that in order for this to work, access to the static file(s) named
    must be allowed (by the `allow` or `rules` keys for this location).
* `expires`:
    How long to allow static assets from this location to be cached (this
    enables the `Cache-Control` and `Expires` headers). Can be a time or *-1*
    for no caching (default). Times can be suffixed with "ms" (milliseconds), "s"
    (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours), "d" (days), "w" (weeks), "M"
    (months, 30d) or "y" (years, 365d).
* `scripts`:
    Whether to allow loading scripts in that location (*true* or *false*).
* `allow`:
    Whether to allow serving files which don't match a rule (*true* or *false*,
    default: *true*).
* `rules`:
    Specific overrides for a specific location. The key is a PCRE regular
    expression that is matched against the full request path. Here is a list of
    example regular expressions that you could provide rules for:
    *\\.css$,\\.js$,\\.gif$,\\.jpe?g$,\\.png$,\\.tiff?$,\\.wbmp$,\\.ico$,\\.jng$,\\.bmp$,\\.svgz?$,\\.midi?$,\\.mpe?ga$,\\.mp2$,\\.mp3$,\\.m4a$,\\.ra$,\\.weba$,\\.3gpp?$,\\.mp4$,\\.mpe?g$,\\.mpe$,\\.ogv$,\\.mov$,\\.webm$,\\.flv$,\\.mng$,\\.asx$,\\.asf$,\\.wmv$,\\.avi$,\\.ogx$,\\.swf$,\\.jar$,\\.ttf$,\\.eot$,\\.woff$,\\.otf$,/robots\\.txt$*.

*Example*

```yaml
web:
    locations:
        "/":
            root: "public"
            passthru: "/index.php"
            index:
                - index.php
            expires: -1
            scripts: true
            allow: true
            rules:
                \.mp4$:
                    allow: false
                    expires: -1
        # Set a 5 min expiration time for static files here; a missing URL
        # will passthru to the "/" location above, and hit the application
        # front-controller.
        "/sites/default/files":
            expires: 300
            passthru: true
            allow: true
```

### Disk

The `disk` defines the size of the persistent disk of the
application in MB.

> **Note**
> The minimum recommended disk size is 256MB. If you see the error `UserError: Error building the project: Disk size may not be smaller than 128MB`, increase the size to 256MB.

### Mounts

The `mounts` is an object whose keys are paths relative to the root of
the application (That is, where the `.platform.app.yaml` file lives). It's in the form `volume_id[/subpath]`.
At this time, the only legal `volume_id` is `shared:files`.

For example with Drupal, you'll want your `sites/default/files` to be
mounted under a shared resource which is writable.

The format is:

* `"/web/sites/default/files": "shared:files/files"`

> **Note**
> The `shared` means that the volume is shared between your applications inside an environment. The `disk` key defines the size available for that `shared` volume.

### Build dependencies

The `dependencies` allow you to specify dependencies that your
application might need during the build process.

Platform.sh supports pulling any dependencies for the following
languages:

* PHP
* Python
* Ruby
* Node.js
* Java (with integrated Maven and Ant support)

Those dependencies are independent of the eventual dependencies of your
application, and are available in the `PATH`, during the build process
and in the runtime environment of your application.

You can specify those dependencies like this:

```yaml
dependencies:
  php:
    drush/drush: "6.4.0"
  python:
    behave: "*"
  ruby:
    sass: "3.4.7"
  nodejs:
    grunt-cli: "~0.1.13"
```

### Hooks

The `hooks` let you define shell commands to run during the build and deployment processes.

They can be executed at various points in the lifecycle of the
application (build/deploy).

Possible hooks are:

-   **build**: We run a build hook before your application has been
    packaged. No other services are accessible at this time since the
    application has not been deployed yet.
-   **deploy**: We run a deploy hook after your application has been
    deployed and started. You can access other services at this stage
    (MySQL, Solr, Redis...). However, the disk where the application lives is read-only at this point.

Each hook is executed as a single script, so they will be considered failed
only if the final command in them fails. To cause them to fail on the first
failed command, add `set -e` to the beginning of the hook.

The `home` directory for each hook is the application root. If your scripts
need to be run from the doc root of your application you will need to `cd` to it
first; e.g.: `cd web`.

After a Git push, you can see the results of the `deploy` hook in the
`/var/log/deploy.log` file when logged in to the environment via SSH. It
contains the log of the execution of the deployment hook. For example:

```bash
[2014-07-03 10:03:51.100476] Launching hook 'cd public ; drush -y updatedb'.

My_custom_profile  7001  Update 7001: Enable the Platform module.
Do you wish to run all pending updates? (y/n): y
Performed update: my_custom_profile_update_7001
'all' cache was cleared.
Finished performing updates.
```

#### [Example] Compile SASS files using Grunt

As a good example combining dependencies and hooks, you can compile your
SASS files using Grunt.  (The `|` character tells YAML that the following lines
should be read as a single string, which allows us to run multiple commands or
even use bash syntax for conditionals, as in the second example.)

In your `.platform.app.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ruby:
    sass: "3.4.7"
  nodejs:
    grunt-cli: "~0.1.13"

hooks:
  build: |
    cd public/profiles/project_name/themes/custom/theme_name
    npm install
    grunt
```

This requires the `package.json` and `Gruntfile.js` files to be
correctly setup in the theme folder.

#### [Example] Trigger deploy hook on a specific environment

To trigger a deploy hook only on a specific environment/branch, use the following
environment variable: `$PLATFORM_BRANCH` that you put in a `if/then` statement.

In your `.platform.app.yaml` file:

```yaml
hooks:
  deploy: |
    if [ $PLATFORM_BRANCH = "master" ]; then
      # Use Drush to disable the Devel module on the Master environment.
      drush dis devel -y
    else
      # Use Drush to enable the Devel module on other environments.
      drush en devel -y
      # Sanitize your database and get rid of sensitive information from Master environment.
      drush -y sql-sanitize --sanitize-email=user_%uid@example.com --sanitize-password=custompassword
    fi
    drush -y updatedb
```

### Crons / Cronjobs

The `crons` is an object describing processes that are triggered on a
schedule.

It has a few subkeys which are:

-   **spec**: The cron specification. For example: `*/20 * * * *`.
-   **cmd**: The command that is executed, for example
    cd public ; drush core-cron\`

The minimum interval between cron runs is 5 minutes, even if specified as less.

### URL rewrite

Platform.sh supports using URL rewrite in your application. To do so, you have to add a `rules` block to a location.
Here is an example to rewrite `/blog/20140513` to `/blog.php?bid=20140513`.

```
web:
  locations:
    "/":
      root: "public"
      passthru: "/index.php"
        rules:
          ^/blog/(?<bid>.*)$:
            passthru: /blog.php?bid=$bid
```

### Runtime

The `.platform.app.yaml` file also supports a `runtime` key, which allows selected customizations to the language runtime. As those possibilities vary by language, please see the appropriate language documentation.

* [PHP](/languages/php.md)

## Top level document roots

Platform.sh requires that the document root not be at the root of the project.  It is important for security that
private file mounts not be web-accessible.

## Upgrading from previous versions of the configuration file.

Although we make an effort to always maintain backward compatibility in the `.platform.app.yaml` format, we do from time to time [upgrade the file](/configuration/app/upgrading.md) and encourage you to upgrade as well.
